# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Implementations of some basic data structures and algorithms in Python. (For personal use only.)

Data Structures:

- link (linked list)
- stack
- binary tree
- priority_queue (heap)
- graph
- digraph
- edge-weighted graph and digraph

Graph algorithms implemented:

- BFS and DFS (cycle detection, two-colouring, component counting)
- Minimum Spanning Tree:
  - Prim's algorithm
  - Kruskal's algorithm
